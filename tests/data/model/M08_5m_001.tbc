! EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES
! Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M01_002_L.SHP			! This GIS layer is commented out / removed from the model as the boundaries are now represented in 1Doundaries are now represented in 1D
! Read GIS SA == gis\2d_sa_M01_002_R.SHP			! This GIS layer is commented out / removed from the model and replaced with direct rainfall across the entire model extent

If Scenario == DEV	| EXG							! Commands specific to the 'DEV' and 'EXG' Scenarios
!  Read GIS SA PITS == gis\2d_sa_M07_001_R.SHP  	! This GIS layer is commented out / removed from the model and replaced with direct rainfall across the entire model extent
	Read GIS RF == gis\2d_rf_M08_001_R.SHP			! This GIS layer applies a direct rainfall inflow

Else If Scenario == FINB1 | FINB2 | FINB3			! Commands specific to the 'FINB1', 'FINB2' or 'FINB3' Scenarios
													! No additional commands are read in for the 'EXG', 'FINB1', 'FINB2' or 'FINB3' Scenarios
Else												! Commands specific to all other scenarios  
    Pause == Scenario not recognised				! The command pauses the model and outputs the message 'Scenario not recognised' and is used as a means of capturing any errors
End If 												! Indicates the end of the logic block of commands

! INTERNAL (1D/2D) BOUNDARIES
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_P.SHP		! This command reads in SX boundaries linking the 1D culverts to the 2D domain
! Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_L.SHP	! This command is commented out / removed from the model as the culvert is now connected to the 1D representation of the creek channel

If Scenario == EXG | FINB1 | FINB3				! Commands specific to the 'EXG', 'DEV', 'FINB1', or 'FINB3' Scenarios
  Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M04_HX_001_L.SHP		! This command reads in HX boundaries linking the 1D creek channel to the 2D domain 
  
Else If Scenario == DEV | FINB2  				! Commands specific to the 'DEV' or 'FINB2' Scenarios 
  Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M06_HX_001_L.SHP		! This command reads in HX boundaries linking the 1D bridge to the 2D domain
 
Else											! Commands specific to all other scenarios
    Pause == Scenario not recognised			! The command pauses the model and outputs the message 'Scenario not recognised' and is used as a means of capturing any errors
