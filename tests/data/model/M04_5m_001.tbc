! EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES
! Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M01_002_L.shp	! This GIS layer is commented out / removed from the model as the boundaries are now represented in 1D
Read GIS SA == gis\2d_sa_M01_002_R.shp		! This command reads in the Eastern SA (source area) boundary

! INTERNAL (1D/2D) BOUNDARIES
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_P.SHP		! This command reads in SX boundaries linking the 1D culverts to the 2D domain
! Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_L.SHP	! This command is commented out / removed from the model as the culvert is now connected to the 1D representation of the creek channel
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M04_HX_001_L.shp		! This command reads in HX boundaries linking the 1D creek channel to the 2D domain
