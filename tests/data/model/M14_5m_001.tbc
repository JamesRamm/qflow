! EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M01_002_L.shp	! This command reads in the Western QT (flow-time) and HQ (stage-discharge) boundaries
Read GIS SA == gis\2d_sa_M01_002_R.shp	! This command reads in the Eastern SA (source area) boundary

! INTERNAL (1D/2D) BOUNDARIES
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_P.shp									! This command reads in SX boundaries linking the 1D culverts to the 2D domain (points layer)
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M02_culv_001_L.shp									! This command reads in SX boundaries linking the 1D culverts to the 2D domain (polyline layer)
Read GIS BC == gis\2d_bc_M14_pump_001_L.shp | gis\2d_bc_M14_pump_001_P.shp	! This command reads in the SH boundary (flow-head) representing a pump
